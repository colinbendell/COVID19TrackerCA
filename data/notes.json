As a result, there may be days where no new data is reported, or only data from select regions is updated. We will continue to aggregate data as released, and will return to daily reporting when daily data becomes available again.<\/p>\r\n<p>Notably, Saskatchewan is transitioning to report data only once per month. Additionally, despite far surpassing legislated <i>Freedom of Information Act<\/i> timelines, our FOI request to the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health for vaccination data by health region has not been filled. As a result, vaccination data by region in Saskatchewan has not been updated since early March, 2022.<\/p>","tag":null,"type":"success","expiry_date":null,"priority":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]
