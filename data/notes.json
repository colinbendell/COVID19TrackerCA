[{"id":4,"title":"Saskatchewan: Missing Data and Limited Weekly Reporting ","description":"<p>Saskatchewan's new weekly reports lack a number of metrics previously tracked and contain significantly delayed data, as COVID-19 deaths increase and hospitalizations rise to record levels in the province. No daily breakdown of data is provided, and the majority of previously reported raw data is no longer published. As a result, only a single value for cases, fatalities and tests can be consistently updated weekly. Current hospitalizations \/ <u>adult<\/u> ICUs are reported for a single day each week and the province no longer reports PICU\/NICU cases due to COVID-19.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, vaccination data released for Saskatchewan lacks the detail to differentiate between incomplete and completed series (1st and 2nd doses) and entirely lacks any raw data for regional vaccination rates. As a result, there will be further delays before vaccination data is updated again for the province.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are pursuing every available avenue to regain access to accurate data for a more complete and up-to-date picture of the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan. We will continue to provide updates as they become available.<\/p>","tag":null,"type":"success","expiry_date":null,"priority":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]
