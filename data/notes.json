[{"id":3,"title":"We've made some changes to our reporting for Ontario","description":"<p>\r\nSince April 2020, we've tracked Ontario cases based on data reported by each of Ontario's 34 Public Health Units (PHUs). This method resulted in significantly more up-to-date data and also included some fatalities not reported provincially. At the time, it made sense to use the data reported by the local organizations responsible for reporting and managing COVID-19 cases in Ontario.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, many of the original limitations of the provincial dataset no longer exist. Ontario now provides a complete, comprehensive and up-to-date dataset. <b>That's why, starting today, we've updated our dataset and reporting standards to use provincially reported data for Ontario.<\/b> We will still record the often more up-to-date regional data from PHU reporting daily, but our provincial totals will now align with what's reported provincially.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our original dataset for Ontario using PHU data is still available upon request. If you have any questions about this change, please feel free to <a href=\"mailto:noah.little@usask.ca\" style=\"color:white;\">reach out<\/a>. <\/p>","tag":null,"type":"success","expiry_date":null,"priority":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]
