[{"id":3,"title":"Our Ontario data may be different from some sources. Here's why:","description":"<p>\r\nFor Ontario, we don't use the provincial case numbers posted each morning for our data. Instead, we source our data directly from each of the 34 Public Health Units (PHUs), the local organizations who are actually responsible for managing COVID-19 cases in Ontario. In many cases, this results in data that is more up-to-date than the provincial data, <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ontario.ca\/page\/how-ontario-is-responding-covid-19#foot-1\" style=\"color:white;\">according to the province of Ontario<\/a><\/b>.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe discrepancies between provincial and PHU data are the result of different cut-off times, the inclusion of probable cases, and reporting delays. Though our count occasionally does indicate spikes for the next day's provincial report (such as for our December 14th record case increase), our reporting is not intended to be 'predictive' but should instead be considered a more up-to-date parallel count. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nLearn more about our reporting for Ontario <b><a href=\"https:\/\/covid19tracker.ca\/ontario.html\" style=\"color:white;\">here<\/a><\/b>.\r\n<\/p>","tag":null,"type":"success","expiry_date":null,"priority":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]
