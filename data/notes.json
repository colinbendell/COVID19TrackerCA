[{"id":3,"title":"We've made some changes to our reporting for Ontario","description":"<p>\r\nSince April 2020, we've tracked Ontario cases based on data reported by each of Ontario's 34 Public Health Units (PHUs). This method resulted in significantly more up-to-date data, and it made sense to use the data reported by the local organizations actually responsible for reporting and managing COVID-19 cases in Ontario. Even today, PHU data is often more up-to-date than what's reported provincially.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, starting today, we've updated our dataset and reporting standards to use provincially reported data for Ontario. We will still record the often more up-to-date regional from PHU reporting every day, but our provincial totals will now be updated in the morning and will align with what's reported provincially.<\/p>","tag":null,"type":"success","expiry_date":null,"priority":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null}]
